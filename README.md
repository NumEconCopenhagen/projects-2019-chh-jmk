# Submisson of GWM442 (ex-nr. 41) and GXJ882 (ex-nr. 67)

Our submisson consists of three primary folders containing our projects: Dataproject, Modelproject and Examproject.
Apart from the projects, the submission contains both a text file and README file with information about Peer feedback provided by us during this course.

**Dataproject** consists of an analysis considering the three biggest energy firms world wide on the stock market, Exxon Mobile, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron, from the 1st of Januar 2016 to the 20th of March 2019.
We include a proxy for the market consisting of these three firms to have an average development to compare the firms to, apart from directly comparing them. 
We aslo include the oil prices to have another (primarily) energy based industri to compared the firms to, thereby creating a wider perspective of the generel development in the enegy industries.

We find positive trends over the period on average for Chevron and Shell, while Exxon's stock price has been rather stable. We also find a higher volatility in the oil prices than the stock prices.

**NB** the file .csv file for oil prices must be named "Oil_prices.csv", which should be default when downloading it for the first time. Also the folder must be placed at the same location as the modelproject file. 


**Modelproject** consists of an analysis of the consumer's choice considering utility maximazation for one type with Cobb-Douglass, and one type with logarithmic, utility functions.
After considering these, we find the social optimum and illustrate it. Lastly, we consider the firm's maximazation problem where the market settings are choosen by the user; either monopolistic or competetive markets.


**Examproject** consists of three main questions, all related to model creation.

*First qustion* is about maximizing utility of a worker living in two periods, with no savings or borrowing. We analyse the labor choice desicions based on human capital. 

*Second question* is about considering a AD-AS model settings and solving for equalibria and simulating them and illustrating the AR(1) process of the model for certain parameters.

*Third question* is considering an exchange economy with three types of goods and a population of 500 consumers. First considering the budget shares of the different goods for the consumers and illustration the demand function, ultimately to consider the Walras-equalibrium.
