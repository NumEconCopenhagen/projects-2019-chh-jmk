# Dataproject

Our project has been placed in the folder above and has been named dataproject. The dataproject contains an interactive part, and we therefore normally recommend that you open the file in jupyter lab. However the widgets don't display when testing it.

Therefore you should open it via Jupyter lab using Anaconda og run the codes.
Download the files, open jupyter lab using anaconda, locate the downloaded file in "projects-2019-chh-jmk-master" -> 
"dataproject" ->  "dataproject.ipynb".


The project itself contains a descriptive analysis of the three largest energy companies in the world, Shell, Exxon and Chevron.
We compare the companies on the stock market in the period between 2016(1,1) and 2019(3,20).
